<h2> Access to the Rest API</h2>
<h3>
  My Json Server has been hosted on Heroku and you can make POST GET PATCH DELETE methods to the Api.
  To Check the db.json file click the following click:
  https://hmsphase2project.netlify.app/
</h3>
This website has been hosted remotely on Netlify. The Link to the hosted page is : https://hmsdemonetlify.netlify.app/
If you need help hosting your website on Netlify Access the below documentation for guidance.

Step 1: Install or create
Open your terminal and enter the following:

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app hello-world
cd hello-world
npm run build

npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify deploy

Or deploy a create-react-app site with Netlify Functions support with just 1 click:

Deploy to Netlify

Step 2: Choose a new project
If you are using the netlify CLI, 
follow command line prompts and choose yes for new project and ./build as your deploy folder and voila you have a production React app!
You can also link to a GitHub repo for continuous deployment for specified branches and will grant you our nifty Deploy Preview feature.

Happy Hacking :)

Step 3: Redirect and rewrite rules
If you choose to use something for routing (like React Router for example), you will need to set up a redirect and rewrite rule for the single page app.

That redirect rule would look like this:

/*    /index.html   200
This redirect rule above will serve the index.html instead of giving a 404 no matter what URL the browser requests.

You can add redirect rules to the _redirects file or to your netlify.toml config file. For more information on redirects on Netlify checkout the docs.

Go forth and React!
