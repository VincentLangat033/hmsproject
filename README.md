<h2> Access to the Rest API</h2>
<h3>
  My Json Server has been hosted on Heroku and you can make POST GET PATCH DELETE methods to the Api.

This website has been hosted remotely on Netlify. The Link to the hosted page is : https://hmsdemonetlify.netlify.app/
If you need help hosting your website on Netlify Access the below documentation for guidance.

Step 1: Install or create
Open your terminal and enter the following:

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app hello-world
cd hello-world
npm run build

npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify deploy

Or deploy a create-react-app site with Netlify Functions support with just 1 click:

Deploy to Netlify

Step 2: Choose a new project
If you are using the netlify CLI, 
follow command line prompts and choose yes for new project and ./build as your deploy folder and voila you have a production React app!
You can also link to a GitHub repo for continuous deployment for specified branches and will grant you our nifty Deploy Preview feature.

Happy Hacking :)

Step 3: Redirect and rewrite rules
If you choose to use something for routing (like React Router for example), you will need to set up a redirect and rewrite rule for the single page app.

That redirect rule would look like this:

/*    /index.html   200
This redirect rule above will serve the index.html instead of giving a 404 no matter what URL the browser requests.

You can add redirect rules to the _redirects file or to your netlify.toml config file. For more information on redirects on Netlify checkout the docs.

Go forth and React!
